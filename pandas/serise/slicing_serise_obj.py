Basics of Pandas Series Slicing
Series slicing can be done by using the [:] operator, 
which allows you to select subset of elements from the 
series object by specified start and end points.

Below are the syntax's of the slicing a Series âˆ’

Series[start:stop:step]: It selects elements from start to end with 
specified step value.

Series[start:stop]: It selects items from start to stop with step 1.

Series[start:]: It selects items from start to the rest of the object with step 1.

Series[:stop]: It selects the items from the beginning to stop with step 1.

Series[:]: It selects all elements from the series object.
