"""
Getting some elements out of an existing array and creating a new array 
out of them is called filtering.

In NumPy, you filter an array using a boolean index list.

A boolean index list is a list of booleans corresponding to indexes in the array.

If the value at an index is True that element is contained in the filtered array, 
if the value at that index is False that element is excluded from the filtered array.


âœ… Summary:

arr[condition] â†’ basic way (boolean mask)

np.isin() â†’ filter by membership

np.nonzero() â†’ filter non-zeros

#The example above will return [41, 43,47], why?
#Because the new array contains only the values where 
# the filter array had the value True, in this case, index 0 and 2.

#In the example above we hard-coded the True and False values, 
# but the common use is to create a filter array based on conditions.

# Creating Filter Directly From Array

#The above example is quite a common task in NumPy and NumPy

#We can directly substitute the array instead of the iterable 
# variable in our condition and it will work just as we expect it to.

arr = np.array([0, 7, 0, 8, 0,9])
