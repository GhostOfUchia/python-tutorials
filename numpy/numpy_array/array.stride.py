ðŸ”¹ What is a stride?

A stride tells NumPy how many bytes to move in memory to get to the next element 
along each axis.

Think of a NumPy array as a big block of memory.

Strides are like instructions: "how far to jump in memory 
to get the next row, column, etc."

Stride = memory jump per axis.

It depends on shape, data type (bytes per element), and slicing.

var1 = np.array([1,2,3,4])

# print(var1)  # [1 2 3 4]

# print(var1.strides) #  Output (on most systems, int64 = 8 bytes):(8,)

# The stride (8,) indicates that each element is 8 bytes apart in memory,
#  which is typical for an array of integers âˆ’

# The strides (24, 8) indicate that to move from one row to the next,
#  24 bytes are skipped, and to move from one column to the next,
#  8 bytes are skipped âˆ’

# Transposing the array changes the strides, reflecting 
# the new memory layout as shown in the example below âˆ’

# print(var4)  #[[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]

# print(var3.strides) #(24,8)

# What is np.zeros()?

# It creates a NumPy array filled with all zeros.
# Useful when you need an array of a certain size but with initial values = 0.

var5[::4, 5]

Here, var5 is probably a 2D NumPy array.
The slicing has two parts (before and after the comma):

::4 â†’ row selection (first dimension)

: means "take all rows 
other wise if we give any number like 4,5,8 it can pic up specific index valve".

::4 means "take every 4th row starting from the beginning (index 0)".
4:: means take skip for row from started and take all back rows

5 â†’ column selection (second dimension)

Just 5 means "take the element at column index 5".

How to Read These Strides

For shape = (2, 3, 4):

2 "blocks" (depth)

Each block has 3 rows

Each row has 4 columns

Strides = (96, 32, 8):

96 bytes â†’ move to the next block (because each block = 3Ã—4Ã—8 = 96 bytes).

32 bytes â†’ move to the next row inside a block (4 elements Ã— 8 bytes each).

8 bytes â†’ move to the next element in the row (1 element Ã— 8 bytes).
