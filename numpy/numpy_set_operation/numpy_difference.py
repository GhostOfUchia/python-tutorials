"""
In NumPy, the difference operation is used to find elements present in 
one array but not in another. It is commonly used to compare two arrays 
and identify the unique elements in one array that do not exist in the other.

In NumPy, the setdiff1d() function is used to perform this operation.

Performance Considerations
The numpy.setdiff1d() function is quite efficient, but performance can 
be a consideration when dealing with large arrays.

If your arrays contain only unique elements, you can use the assume_unique 
parameter to speed up the computation.

Example
By setting theassume_unique parameter to True, NumPy optimizes the 
operation when dealing with arrays that already contain unique elements, 
leading to faster performance as shown in the example below âˆ’
"""
# Define arrays with unique elements
a1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
a2 = np.array([3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

# Find the difference assuming unique elements
difference6= np.setdiff1d(a1, a2, assume_unique=True)

print("Difference with unique elements:", difference6)
